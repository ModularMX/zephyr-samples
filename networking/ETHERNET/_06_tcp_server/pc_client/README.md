# PC TCP Client for Zephyr TCP Server Example

This script provides a simple TCP client to test the Zephyr TCP server (Example 6).

## Usage

1. Make sure your Zephyr board is running Example 6 (TCP Server).
2. Run this script on your PC:

```bash
python tcp_client.py
```

The client will connect to the Zephyr TCP server and send test messages, verifying the echo response.
