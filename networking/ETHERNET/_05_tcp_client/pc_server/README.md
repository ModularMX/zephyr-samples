# PC Echo Server for Zephyr TCP Client Example

This script provides a simple TCP echo server to test the Zephyr TCP client (Example 5).

## Usage

1. Make sure your Zephyr board is running Example 5 (TCP Client).
2. Run this script on your PC:

```bash
python tcp_echo_server.py
```

The server will listen for connections from the Zephyr TCP client and echo back any received data.
